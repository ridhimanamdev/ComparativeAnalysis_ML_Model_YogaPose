To summarize, our study investigated the prediction of yoga poses using several ML models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, traditional ML methods, and novel techniques like MediaPipe Pose Estimation. We evaluated the strengths, constraints, and suitability of these methods in the identification of yoga poses.
The results of our study emphasize the efficacy of modern machine learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in properly identifying intricate yoga positions under various settings and among practitioners with different demographic characteristics. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have potential for incorporation into computer vision applications related to yoga and fitness.
